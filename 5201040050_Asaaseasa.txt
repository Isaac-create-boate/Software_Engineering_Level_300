1. Software process models are convenient tools that developers use to map every step of their projects. Is a digital or hand-written model that details the software development process.
They help project managers plan their process, estimate costs, identify challenges and communicate with teams and customers.

2. The main difference is that waterfall is a linear system of working that requires the team to complete each project phase before working on to the next one while Agile encourages the team to work simultaneously on different phases of the project.
Waterfall has a fixed timeline. The idea is that the start and finish of the project are already mapped out from the beginning whereas agile is a lot more flexible and accounts for experimenting with different directs.
Waterfall is a linear project progression, so it's best suited for projects with a defined end goal whereas agile leaves a lot of room to adapt and change course as the project develops. It's better suited for projects where the outcome may be dependent on more research or testing.

3. Rational unified process is a software development process for object oriented models.
Is the ultimate guide for assigning tasks and responsibilities withins a developer organization and developing high quality software that meets the needs and requirements of its users.
It also uses visual models organized around objects and goes through analysis design and implementation

The phases are:
Inception, Elaboration, Construction and Transition 

It allows you to deal with changing requirements regardless of whether they are coming from the customer or from the project itself.
It emphasizes the need for accurate documentation.
It forces integration to happen throughout the software development, more specifically in the construction phases.
